![covid19](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Coronavirus-Analysis-and-Visualization/blob/main/Graph/Coronavirus%20complication.jpg)

This project aims to analyze and understand the spread of coronavirus throughout the world. Covid-19 is the official name of this virus which named by World Health Organization.

Coronaviruses are types of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tracts of birds and mammals, including humans. Doctors associate them with the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and they can also affect the gut. These viruses are typically responsible for common colds more than serious diseases.

This virus is a contagious coronavirus that outburst from Wuhan in China. This new strain of virus has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. This dataset will help us understand the spread of Covid-19 aroud the world.

# Covid-19 Analysis and Visualization
**Total confirmed cases in Covid-19 of affected continents**

![scatter](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Coronavirus-Analysis-and-Visualization/blob/main/Graph/scatter.png)

The scatter above illustrates the numbers of confirmed cases of Covid-19 among 7 continents in the world. The scatter highlights that Europe is the worst affected continent compare to others as it reach to total 200 million confirmed cases. Asia is the second worst of affected continents it has 150 million confirmed cases; North Ameirica rank to the thrid and the fourth goes to South America followed by Africa and Oceania.

As of May 2022, Over 520 million confirmed cases have been reported globally. This is not a bright sign as it can tell the pandemic has impacted almost every corner of life.This may probably due to an opportunity to stop the spread of the virus during its early stages was missed and it caused serious consequences for many countries such as causing economies to stall, stretching healthcare systems to the limit and governments have been forced to implement harsh restrictions on human activity to control the spread of the virus.

**The Ratio of Situation of Covid-19**

**The Global Situation of Covid-19**

![continent](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Coronavirus-Analysis-and-Visualization/blob/main/Graph/continent%20bar.png)

Two chart above Pie and Bar indicate the situation of Covid-19 throughout the world. The Pie chart is about the ratio of Covid-19 situation whereas the Bar chart is showing the total number of cases. Both charts are divide into 5 categories; confirmed, active, newcases, deaths and recovered cases.
According to the charts, out of over 525 mil confirmed cases reported globaly, over 480 million recovered cases have been reported which is 92% cases have been recovered from the pandemic.
6.8% which is 36 million cases are still active and over 6 million cases which 1.2% people have been reported deaths. It can be seen from information that active and deaths cases reported are less than half numbers compare to recovered cases.
It is clear that the world are getting recovered from pandemic of Covid-19. This may due to goverments around the world have been made a great efforts to emphasize on pandamic prevention and medical attention.
Also, many countries and societies are dedicating to furthering the vaccination ever since numerous vaccines begin their roll out in countries across the world.
